## About Me

I am a 13-year-old Saudi developer with a strong background in JavaScript. I specialize in building Discord bots and am currently expanding my skills in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and full-stack web development. I also explore mobile and game development using Unreal Engine, with some projects succeeding and others serving as valuable learning experiences.

I am passionate about artificial intelligence, assistive tools, and the future of programming and automation. Iâ€™m always curious, always learning.

## Personal Traits

- Diagnosed with bipolar disorder
- Multipersonal and self-aware
- Independent thinker and highly driven

I have a low tolerance for:
- Annoying behavior
- Ignorance
- Backward mentalities

Although I enjoy forming connections, my relationships often fail due to not finding people who align with my mindset and values.
